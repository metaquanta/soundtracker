6) Huge CPU overhead (partially fixed); Also sample display redrawing takes too much CPU
when sample is being changed. Make a separate thread for redrawing?
9) Contains a lot of obsolete code. Try to compile finally with -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
14) some CPU-consuming code in the instrument list selection callback (really 
in the callback) and main notebook switch callback;
22) Convert ESD driver into the modern Pulseaudio API.
36) Pressing Ctrl-O in Instrument editor crashes ST at some machines;
49) JACK driver master mode;
54) Using discretization frequency > 64 kHz gives wrong notes (pitch is 2 times higher, independent on
the discretization frequency). It is a mixer bug, file output does the same. This bus appears with
asm/C/integer mixers, so it might be coming from somewhere else;
55) Cleanup sun audio driver;
58) Check (wet.xm) why after opening original ft2 xm and saving it as is some fields in the instrument
header are different;
59) Complete Russian translation and cheat-sheet page, check what happens with sl.po;
61) Generate "Button release" event at file chooser when selecting the 
file. Seems this should help against "weird dragging" and using of Menu 
button in the tracker;
62) Record indicator for the sampling monitor in record mode; display 
the whole sample after recording;
63) Recording from ALSA works, but not stably;

Scopes stop working at some relation between sound and scopes buffer. Explore this issue and probably
exclude manual scope buffer size setting. Or remain it for after time?

Notes on jack driver.
1) All action should be performed inside audio thread. Jack's process() 
function have only to initiate the execution of audio thread loop (see 
how this is implemented inside ALSA library).
2) Two options: each time 
activate and connect jack client on behalf of playing requiest or keep 
it all the time running and connected, but just disable audio thread 
calling when no playing is being performed.
