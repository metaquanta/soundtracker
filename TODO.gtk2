6) Huge CPU overhead (partially fixed);
9) Contains a lot of obsolete code.
14) some CPU-consuming code in the instrument list selection callback (really 
in the callback);
15) Change option-menu in keys.c with notebook (like in audioconfig.c) for better
widget sizes' behaviour;
16) Fix mouse click at oscilloscopes (not only channel numbers) turn off/on channels;
When scopes are disabled, place empty holder instead of scope/cross
17) Understand why tracker scrolling is such CPU-consuming (compared to ST-Gtk+-1). Maybe it's
a GTK+2.6.7 and is fixed in the modern release?;
21) Native Alsa 1.x driver: make Alsa 1.x the requirement instead of 0.9.x; make sound device
opening non-blocking, but give error dialog instead when the device is busy; signedness handling;
add avalable devices navigation (from csound->rtalsa.c);
22) ESD driver reported to produce greater delay at start than in ST-gtk1;
24) Chechk whether some str functions needed to be replaced with gtk_utf_(strlen,
offset_to_pointer and so on);
26) ESC for Cancel, Enter for Ok keybindings in dialogs;
28) Check and clean all gtk_dialog()s;
29) Provide more info in gtk_about_dialog
30) Degnomization!
31) something's wrong with signals in transposition dialog
32) Clicking at oscilloscopes does not actually mute channels
34) techwavn.xm, pat 6, track 7: something wrooOOOoong with drawing


Regarding gtk_entry_set_text double signal: see gtkentry.c->2059, 2300 (workaround in the ST
sources is made. But a) we need to test whether it's fixed in Gtk+-2.10 and b) we should
push the fixes into the Gtk+-2.0 upstream. NEWS: it's at least fixed at the GTK+ upstream :)
So we need to know from what release this will happen and make corresponding check in
configure.in.

Some remarks about asm mixer bug: at the sample end and loop points there are ugly clicks
(ramping works badly). Also when the previous channel has amplitude > 0, the following one
will be triggered to the minimal negative value (maybe it's a cause of the first issue
'cause really ramping and looping is performing using additional channels. Probably the bug
is in the mixing or post-mixing code.
