Directly after SoundTracker has started, pressing the key "Alt" leads to
(soundtracker:3038): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_widget_event: assertion
'WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed -> this is somehow related to
the FileChooserWidget used in file-operations.c.

permits installation of a font filter, which gets the PangoFontFamily we can
filter on.

3xx bug (Michaël D. <ikari@ifrance.com>)

> There are modules which also use octaves 2 and 6. They are not
> created using Protracker, but when they are loaded into ST, they
> are identified as Protracker modules. The loader even works with
> these.

> > >  * the RelNote settings also work in PT mode.
> >
> > ProTracker has no RelNote.
>
> The Soundtracker GUI has it. It is not disabled. (But that is
> not impotant, just strange.)

> > ProTracker doesn't have a key-off command.
>
> There is also no such thing as an H-8 note ;o) (same thing as
> with the RelNote)
